      <p>Today's rental market in Toronto moves quickly. To increase your chances of securing a great unit we recommend being prepared before you begin your search. Below you'll find the key documents you need and a step‑by‑step overview of the process.

      <h2>Before we begin</h2>
      <p>Landlords want responsible tenants who pay rent on time and care for their homes. A complete and well‑organised application makes a strong first impression. For each adult living in the unit, gather the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment letter</strong> – includes salary, job title and length of employment.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit report</strong> – provide your credit score and history from Equifax, TransUnion or another reputable source.</li>
        <li><strong>Rental application</strong> – use the standard Ontario Real Estate Association form.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo ID</strong> – driver's licence, passport or other government issued ID.</li>
        <li>Optional: recent pay stubs to verify your income.</li>
        <li>Tip: include a professional photo of yourself. While not required, it helps landlords put a face to an application.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The search</h2>
      <p>Complete our renter questionnaire so we can understand your wish‑list. We’ll set up daily email alerts for units that match your criteria. When a listing catches your eye, let us know and we'll preview it. Units often lease quickly, so be prepared to view and rate properties quickly. Most clients rate units based on location, size and layout. Tip: wear shoes that are easy to take on and off when we're touring properties.</p>

      <h2>Submitting an application</h2>
      <p>Once you've found the perfect place, we'll review your offer details – price, move‑in date, and supporting documents. After submission it can take up to two business days to hear back from the landlord. If your offer is accepted you'll need to provide a certified cheque or bank draft for first and last month's rent within 24 hours. Make sure these funds are readily available.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Accepted application</h2>
      <p>After an offer is accepted, landlords typically require the following before move‑in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ten post‑dated cheques or e‑transfer details for rent.</li>
        <li>Tenant insurance – budget around $30–40 per month.</li>
        <li>Hydro/utility confirmation – set up your own hydro account (expect $40–50 per month for a one‑bedroom). Some units require additional utilities.</li>
        <li>Key deposit – usually $100–300, refunded when keys are returned.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Provide the landlord with proof of insurance and hydro set‑up approximately one week before move‑in.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Moving day</h2>
      <p>Reserve the elevator as soon as possible after your application is accepted. Hire movers if needed – we can recommend reliable services. On move‑in day we'll provide the landlord with post‑dated cheques and pick up the keys. We'll also perform a brief inspection of the unit with you to ensure everything is in order.</p>
