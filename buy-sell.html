      <h1>Buy &amp; Sell</h1>
      <h2>Whether you’re a real estate vet or a first‑time buyer, we’re happy to help.</h2>
      <p>Our approach is simple – give selfless service and honest advice on real estate. You’ll get the information you need to make the right decision. We’re never pushy and will offer you the same guidance we’d give our family – whether that means talking you out of the wrong place or encouraging you to wait for a better offer. We’ll treat you like a close friend.</p>

      <h2>Helping you buy</h2>
      <p>Owning property isn’t the right choice for everyone. We'll help you learn about home ownership so you can decide whether it’s the right move for you. We go over the entire buying process — including our role as your agent, how to choose the right mortgage, the best way to search for a home, putting in an offer and what to expect on the day of closing. Our job is to learn about your lifestyle and what’s important to you so we can help you find the perfect home. Instead of trying to sell you a home, we focus on providing a great experience.</p>

      <h2>Helping you sell</h2>
      <p>Selling your home is a big decision, which is why we take the time to get to know you and understand your needs and motivations before offering any advice. We discuss every detail of your home and neighbourhood so we can best target your home to the right buyers. Together we explore activity in your neighbourhood, pricing and marketing strategies. Our goal is to get you the most money for your home and to make the experience as smooth as possible. We do this by guiding you every step of the way.</p>
