      <h1>About Nalin Sharma &amp; SAYVA Real Estate</h1>
      <p><strong>SAYVA</strong> is derived from the Sanskrit word <em>seva</em>, meaning “selfless service.” This ethos guides our interactions with clients, friends and family. As a multi‑generational family business our purpose is to put the needs of others ahead of our own. In real estate this is known as a fiduciary duty; in our daily lives we call it SAYVA.</p>
      <p>Acts of SAYVA are carried out with compassion and a genuine desire to uplift everyone around us. We invite you to join this community. We're not the team that sells the most homes – our focus is on serving our clients at the highest level.</p>
